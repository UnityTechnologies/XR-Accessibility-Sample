# XR Accessibility Sample

The project contains multiple XR packages pre-configured (hands, eye, VR) for a quick solution to get started with some XR Accessible design concepts. Used for demonstration and presentation purposes around "Developing Accessible XR" presentation. 

Addition of the "Accessibility" scene sample which integrates some best practices, supporting creators understanding design constraints during 3D XR Interaction design.
