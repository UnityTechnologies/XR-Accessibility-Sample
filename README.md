# XR Accessibility Sample

The project contains multiple XR frameworks for an out the box solution to get started with some XR Accessible desing. Used for demonstration and presentation purposes around XR Accessibility. 

Supports creators understanding design constraints during 3D XR Interaction design. It should help you get up and running using hand tracking for XR devices. 

This project is forked from Unity's [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@3.1/manual/index.html) (XRI)
